    "==================\n",
    "\n",
    "The harmonic oscillator\n",
    "-----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that simple oscillatory motion is described by a general\n",
    "quadratic potential of the form $$V=\\frac{1}{2}kx^2,$$ where $k$ is a\n",
    "“force constant”. In a spring, this is a measure of the stiffness of the\n",
    "spring. In a pendulum, it is given by $$k=\\frac{mg}{L}$$ where $m$ is\n",
    "the mass of the particle and $L$ its length. From this potential we can\n",
    "extract the force $$F=-\\frac{dV}{dx}=-kx$$ and the equation of motion\n",
    "can be written as \n",
    "$$\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=-\\omega _0 ^2x,\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "where the quantity $\\omega _0$ is defined by\n",
    "$$\\omega _0^2=\\frac{k}{m}$$ The dynamical motion described by these\n",
    "equations is called “simple harmonic motion” and can be solved\n",
    "analytically: $$x(t)=A\\cos{(\\omega _0t+\\delta)},\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "where $a$ is the amplitude of th oscillations and\n",
    "$\\delta$ is a phase that depends on the initial conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now define a period $T$ such as $$x(t+T)=x(t).$$ Since\n",
    "$\\omega _0T$ corresponds to one cycle, we obtain\n",
    "$$T=\\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega _0}=\\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{k/m}}.$$ The frequency\n",
    "$\\nu$ is the number of cycles per unit of time and is given by\n",
    "$\\nu=1/T$. Note that the period of the motion depends on the ratio\n",
    "$k/m$ and is completely independent of the initial conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Large oscillations \n",
    "\n",
    "The pendulum responds to the equation of motion for simple harmonic motion only in\n",
    "the limit of small angles. In the case of large oscillations, the\n",
    "equation has to be modified becoming\n",
    "$$\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2}=-\\frac{g}{L}\\sin{\\theta} = \\omega_0^2 \\sin{\\theta}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy of the pendulum is then given by\n",
    "$$E=\\frac{1}{2}mL^2(\\frac{d\\theta}{dt})^2+mgL(1-\\cos{\\theta})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Damped oscillations \n",
    "\n",
    "If a drag force is included in the problem, the equation of motion\n",
    "becomes: $$\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=-\\omega _0^2 x-\\gamma \\frac{dx}{dt},$$ where\n",
    "the “damping coefficient” gamma is a measure of the friction. Note that\n",
    "the drag force opposes the motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear response to external forces \n",
    "\n",
    "How can we determine the period of a pendulum that is not already in\n",
    "motion? The obvious way is to disturb the system, for instance, applying a\n",
    "small displacement and observe the resulting motion. We will fine that\n",
    "the “response” of a system is actually an intrinsic property of the\n",
    "system and can tell us about its nature in the absence of perturbations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a damped linear oscillator with an external force $F(t)$\n",
    "$$\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=-\\omega _0^2x-\\gamma\\frac{dx}{dt}+\\frac{1}{m}F(t).$$\n",
    "It is customary to interpret the reponse of the system in terms of the angular\n",
    "displacement $x$. The time dependence in $F(t)$ is arbitrary. A\n",
    "particular case is when the force is harmonic:\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{m}F(t)=A_0 \\cos{\\omega t},\n",
    "$$ where $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of the\n",
    "driving force.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resonance \n",
    "\n",
    "The long term behavior of the driven harmonic oscillator depends on the\n",
    "frequency of the driving force. One measure of this behavior is the\n",
    "maximum of the steady state displacement $A(\\omega )$.\n",
